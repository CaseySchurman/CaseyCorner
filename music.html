				<p>This is the page for music reviews. There are reviews for several categories, including Indie, Rock, Electronic, Throwback (90's and beyond), and Feel Good (happy music). Each review contains some background on the musician/band, why I like them, and some info on the song I mention. Each review contains links to a video that will be of one of my favorite songs by the musician/band, so that you get a feel for the music they play. I might even include links to a couple of songs, depending on the musician or band.</p>

				<div class="heading">Beck</div>
				<section>
					<p>If you didn't know much about Beck, you might be very surprised to know that he has been around for a long time, making music for over 20 years. You might be most familiar of him for his hit song "Loser", which was actually released in the early 90's. However, if you've paid attention to the Grammy Awards, you would know that in 2015 he won three Grammys for his album "Morning Phase". Beck is a difficult artist to pin down as far as style goes because he is a very diverse musician. I've listened to several of his albums and they all have a different feel and style. But whether you want to just relax, or get energized for a party, Beck will have something for you.</p>
					<p>One of my favorite song's by Beck is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MukXRVhcNWA">Go It Alone</a>, from his 2005 album Guero. It has an infectious bass-line and is one of his more catchy tunes. Not only that, but the lyrics are interesting, as Beck seems to sing about a character going through different scenes, as if in a movie. I also love that Jack White helped write the song (I'm a big fan), as apparently he was the one that came up with the bass-line while Beck and him were jamming.</p>

				<div class="heading">Jack White</div>
				<section>
					<p>Jack White is one of my favorite artists of all time. He has such a unique style and sound, that when you hear a Jack White song you just know what it is. In particular though, I love the White Stripes, which are also one of my favorite bands of all time. Sadly they have been disbanded for some time now, as Jack White has moved on to other projects. But they still have some of the best rock songs, with Jack's screeching vocals and piercing guitar sound, and Meg White's unique drumming style. Yes, they are only a 2-person band, and you'd be very surprised after hearing some of their songs. While they do have some more mellow songs, I'd say about 80% of their music is intense rock (similar to a hard or punk rock sound), so if you're not a fan of that, then you probably won't be a fan of the White Stripes. But even then, I'd take a listen to hear their unique style.</p>
					<p>You may have heard of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2QdDbelmY">Seven Nation Army</a>, as that's probably their most well known song and biggest hit. However, while that song is definitely one of my favorites, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTH71AAxXmMFell">Fell In Love With A Girl</a> is possibly my favorite. It's such a catchy punk song, almost seeming to take classic punk and putting his own mark on it. The lyrics have some deep meaning as well, as the song is basically about a girl who messes around with guys and doesn't consider the consiquences.</p>

				<span><i>Electronic</i></span>
				<div class="heading">Kygo</div>
				<section>
					<p>Kygo has a unique style in the realm of EDM (Electronic Dance Music), which is one of the main reasons I enjoy listening to his music. In my opinion, the EDM genre has a lot of not-so-great music, with some really great music mixed in. It seems there are a lot of EDM artists who put out the same music with no originality. Kygo doesn't do this, with his own unique style, combining electronic with a tropical sound that makes it very pleasant to listen to, whether you're hanging out with friends or cleaning your room.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8PPap4dJog">Here For You</a> is a perfect example showing Kygo's style of electronic-tropical music.</p>

				<div class="heading">The Beatles</div>
				<section>
					<p>I'm sorry, but if you don't know who the Beatles are, please do yourself a favor and check them out. Not only for yourself, but because of how influential they have been to music. I would be willing to bet that at least half of the popular musician's and bands of today have been influenced one way or another by the Beatles.</p>
					<p>Anyways, since the Beatles are my favorite band of all-time, it's very difficult for me to choose just one song. So, I'll just pick one out of the hat. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kJYVU8uc4Q">The Night Before</a> it is! For nearly any other band, this would have been a career defining hit. However, this song was just another great album track, from their 1965 album Help!. The song has a hard-driving up-tempo style with a motown, pop-rock feel, again showing just how talented the Beatles were.</p>

				<span><i>Feel Good</i></span>
				<div class="heading">Jack Johnson</div>
				<section>
					<p>Jack Johnson is one of those artists, that if you play one of his songs, especially from before 2010, everyone just seems to know it. I can't tell you how many times I'd be hanging out with friends, and then when I'd start playing a Jack Johnson song, everybody sings along. Jack Johnson songs also seem to have an effect with the ladies (use responsibly men, it can quickly get out of control).</p>
					<p>Jack Johnson also is basically the definition of feel good music. Like his song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u57d4_b_YgI">Better Together</a>, from his album (my personal favorite) In Between Dreams. The song, if you couldn't guess from the lyrics (or title), is about how even when things are hard in life, that when he's with this girl everything feels alright in the world. If you aren't familiar with him, I would definitely recommend checking out his In Between Dreams album, pretty much every song on there is a classic.</p>
